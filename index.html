            <h2>Food For Family</h2>
            <p>
                All human food has been submerged due to the floods. Cattle are dying
                and there is a food crisis. In this situation, many children and many
                people passed their days without dinking any water or meal . We should
                stand by them .

            <h2>Shelter For a Family</h2>
            <p>
                Due to the floods, people's houses have been submerged and there is no
                shelter for people. They are located in different educational
                institutions. We should arrange their accommodation and help them
                accordingly.

            <p>
                Due to the floods, school going college students are not able to
                continue their studies properly, their studies are being disrupted so
                we have to take appropriate steps to continue their studies properly
                so that the nation does not lag behind.
